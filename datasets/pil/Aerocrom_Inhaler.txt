How to take

Aerocrom Inhaler

  --
  --

2 Shake the inhaler well (at least 5 times) If the inhaler has not been
used for more than 2 days or if you are using it for the first time,
release one puff into the air

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --
  3 Holding the inhaler well away from your mouth, breathe out as far as is comfortable. To avoid condensation and blockage of the spray DO NOT breathe out through the inhaler   
  4 Holding the inhaler as shown, place it in your mouth and close your lips around it                                                                                            
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --

5 Start to breathe in SLOWLY and deeply through your mouth, then
immediately press the metal canister down firmly whilst continuing to
breathe in.

  --
  --

6 Remove the inhaler from your mouth and hold your breath for about 10
seconds, or as long as is comfortable then breathe out slowly.

7 Wait for about 1 minute before repeating steps 2 to 6 once more.

8 After use always replace the mouthpiece cover to keep out dust and
fluff.

Check your technique in front of a mirror, or with a pharmacist or
doctor from time to time If you see a mist escaping from your mouth or
around the sides of the canister, you may not have your lips closed
properly around the mouthpiece or you may not have started breathing in
before pressing the canister. Next time try to ensure all the mist is
breathed in.
