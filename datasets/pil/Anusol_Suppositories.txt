+---+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
|   | 1 Remove the plastic cover before insertion.                    |
|   |                                                                 |
|   | Tear along the perforation to remove one suppository from the   |
|   | strip.                                                          |
|   |                                                                 |
|   | 2 Grasp the two halves of the plastic cover at the coloured     |
|   | end, holding them firmly between the thumb and forefinger of    |
|   | each hand.                                                      |
|   |                                                                 |
|   | Gently pull apart to expose the suppository fully.              |
+---+-----------------------------------------------------------------+

Adults: Wash the anal area thoroughly and dry carefully with a soft
towel. Remove the suppository from the plastic cover and insert as
deeply into the anus as possible. One suppository should be inserted at
night, in the morning, and after each bowel movement until the condition
is controlled.

Anusol Suppositories are specially shaped for easy insertion into the
anus. You may find insertion of the suppositories easier if you place
one foot on a chair or lie on your side with one leg drawn up as high as
possible under the chin.

Children: Not recommended for children.

Important information

· Do not use Anusol Suppositories if you are allergic to any of the
ingredients.

· Anusol Suppositories are not to be swallowed. If accidental ingestion
occurs, seek medical advice.

· Haemorrhoids and other anal conditions are sometimes of a serious
nature. In cases of rectal bleeding or a condition that persists or
worsens, consult your doctor.

How to store Anusol Suppositories

· Store the Suppositories in a cool, dry place in the original
packaging.

· Do not use after the expiry date shown on the box.
