Anafranil contains clomipramine which is used to treat depression.
Doctors sometimes prescribe Anafranil for other purposes. Ask your
doctor for information.

What's in your medicine

× Anafranil capsules come in three sizes containing 10mg, 25mg or 50mg
of clomipramine hydrochloride.

× These capsules also contain lactose.

Before taking your medicine

× Have you ever had a rash or other possible allergic reaction whilst
taking antidepressants?

× Do you suffer from any serious heart or liver disease?

× Do you suffer from glaucoma (increased eye pressure) or difficulty in
passing water?

× Do you suffer from any mental illness other than depression?

× Have you had a heart attack within the past three months?

× Are you taking or have you recently taken any other medicines for
depression (particularly monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs])?

If the answer to any of these questions is YES, DO NOT take the capsules
without talking to your doctor again.

× Do you suffer from epilepsy (fits)?

× Do you have an overactive thyroid gland?

× Are you taking any medicines for high blood pressure?

× Are you taking any other medicines (including cold remedies) which
your doctor does not know about?

× Are you pregnant, trying to become pregnant or breast feeding?

If the answer to any of these questions is YES, tell your doctor or
pharmacist.

Taking your medicine

× It is important to take your capsules at the right times. You must
take them as instructed by your doctor. The label will tell you how many
to take and how often. If it does not, or you are not sure, ask your
doctor or pharmacist.

× Swallow your capsules with a drink of water.

× Keep taking your capsules until your doctor tells you to stop. Do not
stop because you do not feel any better. These capsules may take up to
four weeks to work.

× If you forget to take a dose, take the next dose at the usual time. Do
not take a double dose.

× If you accidentally take too many Anafranil capsules tell your doctor
at once or contact your nearest hospital casualty department.

After taking your medicine

These capsules sometimes cause unwanted effects in some people. If you
get any of the following tell your doctor.

× Skin rash or itching for the first time.

× Any yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes.

× Persistent sore throat or fever.

× Dizziness when you stand up.

Other effects which may occur include:

× Headache or dry mouth.

× Weight gain or upset stomach.

× Shakiness of the hands, increased sweating or hot flushes.

× Mild blurring of vision.

× Feeling tired, sleepy or slightly confused.

× Constipation or difficulty in passing water.

× Unusually fast heart beat or palpitations.

These effects are often mild and may wear off after a few days'
treatment. If they are severe or last for more than a few days, tell
your doctor. Also, if your capsules upset you in any other

way, tell your doctor.

Precautions

× Whilst you are taking Anafranil, your doctor may want to carry out a
number of tests from time to time. This is quite usual and nothing to
worry about. You should also have regular dental check ups whilst taking
Anafranil.

× Tell your doctor if you are planning to have an operation of any kind.

× Be careful when drinking alcohol – it may affect you more than usual.

× If you feel dizzy or sleepy when you start to take these capsules, do
not drive or work machinery until this effect has worn off.

× REMEMBER: this medicine is for YOU. Only a doctor can prescribe it for
you. Never give it to someone else. It may harm them even if they have
the same symptoms as you.
