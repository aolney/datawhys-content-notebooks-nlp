Remember

This medicine is for YOU. Only a doctor can prescribe it for you. Never
give it to someone else. It may harm them even if they seem to have the
same symptoms as you have.

How your medicine works

Beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) is one of a group of medicines known
as corticosteroids which helps in the management of asthma.
Beclomethasone dipropionate works by reducing swelling and irritation in
the walls of the small air passages in your lungs. This type of medicine
is known as a ‘PREVENTER’. As it is used to prevent asthma attacks it is
important to use your inhaler regularly even when you have no symptoms
or you feel better.

It may take a few days for this medicine to work. Do not stop taking
your inhaler unless told to do so by a doctor.

You may currently be using an inhaler which acts to open your airways
during an asthma attack (a ’RELIEVER’). This can be safely used together
with your BDP Spacehaler.

IMPORTANT: Do not use this inhaler to provide relief from wheezing or
breathlessness. You will probably need a different kind of medicine in a
different colour pack which your doctor may already have given you.

Who makes it?

BDP Spacehaler is made for Evans Medical Limited by Medevale
Pharmaservices, Vale of Bardsley, Ashton-Under-Lyne, Lancashire, OL7 9RR

before using your inhaler. If you are not sure how or when to take your
BDP Spacehaler ask your doctor or pharmacist. If you forget to use your
