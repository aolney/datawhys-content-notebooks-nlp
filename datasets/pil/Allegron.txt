Please read this leaflet carefully before you start to take your

you have any questions. This leaflet only applies to Allegron.

Your medicine is called Allegron. Its active ingredient is nortriptyline

The tablets are orange or white with ‘DISTA’ on them. They have a line
across them to show you where to break them.

Each orange tablet has 25 milligrams of nortriptyline hydrochloride in
it and each white tablet has 10 milligrams. The tablets also contain the
ingredients starch, magnesium stearate, lactose, calcium phosphate,
glycerine and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. The orange tablets are

Allegron is one of a group of medicines called ‘tricyclic
antidepressants’ that relieve the symptoms of depression.

Allegron is made by Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Kingsclere Road,
Basingstoke, Hampshire, RG21 2XA. The product licence is held by Dista
Products Limited, Dextra Court, Chapel Hill, Basingstoke, Hampshire,
RG21 2SY

Why Allegron?

Allegron is normally used to treat depression, but it is also used to
help stop children bed-wetting.

Before taking your medicine

Make sure it is safe for you to take Allegron. If Allegron is given to
children, they must be at least 6 years old and it must only be given to
help them stop bed-wetting.

If you answer YES to any of the following questions, or you are not
sure, tell your doctor or pharmacist. (If the tablets are for a child,
please answer the questions for that child.)

· Have you ever had a rash or any other allergic reaction to Allegron or
to any other tricyclic antidepressant?

· Have you recently had a heart attack or do you have other heart
problems such as palpitations or irregular heart beats?

· Have you ever had problems with your liver?

· Have you ever had mania or schizophrenia?

· Are you breast-feeding?

· Are you pregnant, or could you be?

· Do you have a thyroid problem?

· Have you ever had epilepsy?

· Are you taking, or have you recently been taking, any medicines known
as monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOls )? MAOls include phenelzine such
as Nardil, tranylcypromine such as Parnate or Parstelin and
isocarboxazid such as Marplan. If you are taking any MAOI or have
stopped taking it within the last 2 weeks, you must not take Allegron

· Are you taking any medicine for your heart or for high blood pressure?

· Do you ever use cough or cold remedies? Do not take them while you are
on Allegron until you have discussed this with your doctor.

· Are you taking cimetidine, such as Tagamet?

· Are you taking any other medicines including other antidepressants or
medicine for bowel complaints, breathing difficulties, bronchitis,
glaucoma or prostate trouble?

· Are you diabetic?

· Antidepressants may not make you feel better for the first two weeks
or more, so carry on taking the tablets. Tell your doctor if you feel
worse than you did before you started taking Allegron.

· Antidepressants may affect your ability to drive or to operate
machinery safely. Do not drive or use machinery unless you are sure your
judgement and co-ordination are not affected.

· If you are having an operation under general anaesthetic, discuss this
with your GP. You may need to stop taking Allegron several days before
the operation. If your GP tells you to carry on taking Allegron, make
sure the doctors treating you in hospital know that you are on Allegron.

· Do not drink alcohol while you are on Allegron. You may get more drunk
or feel more depressed.
